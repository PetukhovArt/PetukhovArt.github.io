        <p class="short">Designed for elite military and law enforcement snipers, the CZ 750 Sniper is built to squeeze

        <p class="description">The synthetic thumbhole stock is adjustable for comb height as well as
            length of pull. The underside of the fore-end is fitted with a 220mm long rail that provides multiple

            mirage shield and two 10-round detachable magazines.The Sniper has a 26" barrel with 4-groove rifling in 1
